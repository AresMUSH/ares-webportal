<h1>Players</h1>

<p>This page lists players and their characters (or 'alts').  </p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    There are two ways to get your characters to show up here: 
    <ul>
        <li>Link a character to your <a href="/help/handles">AresMUSH player handle</a>.</li>
        <li>If you do not have a handle, add a <a href="/help/website/web_profile">profile tag</a> to your character's web portal profile in the form <code>player:&lt;playername&gt;</code>.  Player name can be either your main character's name or some other moniker used to tie your characters together.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Characters linked with the player tag are not verified through AresCentral and will not have the "@" in front of their player name.</p>
