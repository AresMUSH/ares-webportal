{{title 'Roster'}}
<h1>Roster</h1>

<p>The roster contains ready-made characters that you can just pick up and play.  Some have been played before, as indicated by a <span class="label label-info">Previously Played</span> tag.  For most characters, you can claim them just by logging onto the game and using the roster command.  Characters marked with <span class="label label-warning">App Required</span> require a little more work so you'll need to talk to the contact person before claiming them.</p>
